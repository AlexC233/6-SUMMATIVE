Introduction
============
This program simulates the motion of astronomical bodies in 2-d space.
It is based on the [N-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem).
<p>
The simulation utilizes Newtonian mechanics to calculate the gravitational force between bodies. 
<p>
The simulation simulates 500 random bodies in a square region of 1e10 by 1e10 meters.
